# INPUT
There is little user input in this task. In Part 1, the app displays only one profile card with no dynamic input. In Part 2, the user can tap on individual profile cards (thumbnails) to expand or minimize them and display additional information. This touch is utilized as the main input approach for Part 2.

# PROCESS
Part 1 involved the Profile Card component being enhanced with React Native styling techniques in Chapter 4 of the book. We added styled text components to display a user's name, occupation, and a brief bio. Part 2, after Chapter 5, involved adding a gallery of six profile cards using Flexbox for layout. The cards are displayed in a responsive two-column grid layout. Each card was made interactive with state managed using useState to toggle between collapsed and open views

# OUTPUT
A neat, stylish user interface is the result.  One profile card is shown in Part 1, and a responsive, expandable gallery of six cards is shown in Part 2.
