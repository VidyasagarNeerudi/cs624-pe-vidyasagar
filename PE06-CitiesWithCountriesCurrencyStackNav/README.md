# Input

The user interacts with the mobile app using a tab-based navigation bar that contains tabs like CitiesNav, CountriesNav, and AddCountry. Users can examine a list of countries by tapping the "CountriesNav" tab, and then select a country to learn more about it and its currency. Users can also go to the "AddCountry" tab to add a new nation entry. Each tap or selection serves as a user input, triggering navigation or displaying pertinent info.

# Process

After receiving input, the app uses React Navigation to handle screen transitions with both tab and stack navigators. The "CountriesNav" tab directs to a stack navigator with three screens: Countries, Country, and Currency. When a country is selected, the program takes you to the Country screen, followed by the Currency screen if you choose. React Native's state management and props communicate the necessary data between components.

# Output

Based on user input, the application displays a responsive user interface (UI) with nation lists, data, and currency usage status.
